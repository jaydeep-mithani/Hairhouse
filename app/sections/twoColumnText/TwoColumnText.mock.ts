    html: `<p>What hair care products should I use?</p><p>If you are regularly dying your hair and using a range of toners, it is really important that you moisturise your hair regularly using a <a title=\"https://www.hairhouse.com.au/hair/haircare/hair-treatments/hair-mask\" href=\"https://www.hairhouse.com.au/hair/haircare/hair-treatments/hair-mask\">hair mask</a> or deep conditioning treatment. At Hairhouse, you&#39;ll find dozens of hair care treatment options to choose from. Try the <a title=\"https://www.hairhouse.com.au/Harper-Arlo-Repair-Treatment-150mL\" href=\"https://www.hairhouse.com.au/Harper-Arlo-Repair-Treatment-150mL\">Harper and Arlo Repair Treatment</a>, or a <a title=\"https://www.hairhouse.com.au/Miracle-Renew-Mask-250ml\" href=\"https://www.hairhouse.com.au/Miracle-Renew-Mask-250ml\">Pure Miracle Renew Mask</a>.</p><p>There is also a common mistake many people make when it comes to their haircare. Why they have the perfect hydrating shampoo for their hair, they often forget about the skincare of their scalp. Fortunately, you can find many shampoos and conditioners that can nourish the scalp as well as the hair.</p><p>What does hair toner do?</p><p>A <u>hair toner</u> is an important part of the hair colouring process. It is a semi-permanent colouring product that helps to add depth and shine to your colour. Used mainly for blonde hair colouring, toner usually fades within six or eight weeks. The more you wash it, the more frequently you will need to refresh your colour with toner.</p><p>One thing to note is that you can also use hair dye or purple shampoo to tone your hair. Speak with your hairdresser during one of your salon visits or ask a staff member at one of our Hairhouse stores to find out exactly which hair toning products will be right for you.</p><p>How to apply toner to hair?</p><ol><li><div>Once you have completed the initial blonde bleaching process, towel dry your hair, and then apply the toner.</div></li><li><div>Massage the toning product into all the parts of your hair, from the roots to the tips, to ensure that you have full coverage.</div></li><li><div>Make sure that you rinse all of the product from your hair carefully when the time limit is reached and you have achieved the desired tone.</div></li><li><div>If your hair starts to look brassy or yellow again, you can refresh by repeating the toning process.</div></li></ol><p>Seek advice on specific products from one of our friendly staff at a Hairhouse store near you.</p><p>How long to leave toner on hair?</p><p>Usually, a toner is on your hair for about 30 minutes but everyone&#39;s hair is different. Leaving a toner on for too long can drastically affect your hair colour so make sure that you read the instructions on your product packaging and follow them. It&#39;s a good idea to do a swatch test on a tiny patch of your hair so you can see how the colour develops.</p><p>What is the best toner for blonde hair?</p><p>It&#39;s so important to choose the right product when you want to tone your hair. Nobody needs orange or yellow tones messing up their look. Whether your hair is ash blonde or true blonde, orange, yellow or brassy tones can make a huge difference to the end result.</p><p>Sometimes using purple shampoos will give you the desired effect. The Juuce Love Silver Violet is a good one to test out. Trial and error is a part of getting the exact hair colour that you desire. Other options are the Fanola No Orange Shampoo , the Dare to Pearl Toner or something from the De Lorenzo range.</p><p>Where can I get toner for my hair?</p><p>You can purchase your hair toner through our website or in one of our Hairhouse stores. Experienced staff will help you choose the tone that is exactly right for you and your hair.</p><p>Don&#39;t forget that it is equally important to purchase shampoo and conditioner so that you are even supporting your hair colour when you are washing your hair. This is especially important if you are colouring your hair at home and helps to keep your locks healthy and vibrant. Hairhouse has a full range of shampoos and conditioners for coloured and bleached hair.</p><p>Be careful if you have virgin hair that has never been dyed or chemically processed. Get professional advice to ensure that you are using quality products that suit your hair type.</p><p>How can I reduce frizz?</p><p>Frizzy hair is often genetics, so the right anti-frizz haircare treatment becomes all the more important. There are many haircare brands that focus on frizz reduction and enable you to style your hair easier. Olaplex is one of the brands that provide excellent cleansers, shampoos for damaged hair, but also detangler and anti-frizz solutions.</p><p>There are other proven methods to reduce frizz on dry hair or fine hair. One of these methods is by using argan oil, moroccanoil, or keratin oil. Simply apply some of this oil after washing your hair, before styling with a hair straightener or hair dryer. You will find that your hair comes out much smoother and stays that way for the rest of the day (and sometimes even a couple of days). When combined with the previously mentioned shampoos and conditioners, the effect can be quite dramatic.</p><p></p>`,

    html: `<p>When your hair never stays in place due to frizz, using the right hair mousse, hair spray, or hair wax can provide some additional control.</p><p>Finally, individuals who have problems with frizzy hair should also look into the right hair accessories and hair brushes with the right bristle types. As you know, some hair styling accessories and brushes are more likely to cause frizz than others. For example, if your hair tends to tangle as well as frizz, then choose a paddle brush. If you have thicker hair, choose nylon and synthetic bristles.</p><p>Fortunately, there are many anti-frizz options at Hairhouse. Check out the best seller section to find great anti-frizz products to add to your wishlist.</p><p>How does dry shampoo work?</p><p>Dry shampoo can be used as an alternative to hair washing, and can be good for those who suffer from scalp related problems. With dry shampoo, you can reduce the oil on your hair without having to wash your hair. If you often wash your hair due to oiliness, then you can use dry shampoo two to three times a week.</p><p>How can I hydrate my hair?</p><p>Dry hair can have numerous causes, so the solution can be different depending on the cause. However, common causes of dry hair include contact with chlorinated water, excessive hair washing, not using heat protection, and using hair products with sulphates.</p><p>If you suffer from dry hair, it is important to tackle the cause as much as the problem itself. So, if you have dry hair because of sulphates, you must obtain a shampoo that is sulphate free.In addition to eliminating the cause, the right hair and scalp treatments can make a huge difference for dry hair. For example, there are special hydration shampoos, but also hair moisturiser treatments such as leave-in conditioner or a masque. If you always had a tendency for dry hair, then it may be worth to overhaul your hair care routine with these products.</p><p>If you tend to have dandruff as well as dry hair, your hair care should also be focussed on treating the scalp. There are a number of conditioners that are specifically formulated for this purpose, including the Scalpsync Conditioner 250ml, which calms the scalp while nourishing the hair. There are also special exfoliators for the scalp, which can be incorporated in your haircare routine.</p><p>Dry hair can have a tendency to frizz as well. In other words, the use of hair oils can be beneficial for styling purposes, as mentioned earlier.</p><p>Styling dry hair can be done with a number of products. However, one of the most effective is pomade. At Hairhouse, you will find a number of pomades that can be used to easily style dry hair. For more information about each of these products, please refer to the FAQ section in the product description.</p><p>While women often use separate haircare products, there are many men that actually experience dry hair because of the products they use. For example, there are many body wash products that also can be used for the hair, and which are deemed convenient by men. Unfortunately, these products can also dry out hair. Instead, men should use dedicated products for their hair instead of an all-in-one.</p><p>Can I hide grey hair without colouring my hair?</p><p>If you would like to give your hair a bit of a break, you can use so-called grey root concealer instead. Grey root concealer is sprayed onto the hair, which covers up any exposed roots. Of course, this measure is only temporary, but it does give your hair a nice break.</p><p>Which hair product brands are best?</p><p>While it may be easiest to purchase trending shampoos and conditioners, it is best to address your hair concerns first and foremost. Ask yourself which problems you are experiencing with your hair before you choose a haircare brand.</p><p>That being said, some brands provide products that have multiple functions. Kerastase is a prime example. Kerastase has a huge range of product, some of which provide detangling as well as strengthening and moisturising benefits.</p><p>Hair styler products should also follow these basic rules. For example, a GHD hair dryer might perform much better for you than a generic brand, especially if you have trouble taming unruly locks.</p><p>What other products can I obtain at Hairhouse?<br><br>Even though Hairhouse specialises in haircare, you can also obtain other beauty essentials and gifts such as nail polish, body lotion , and tanning products.</p>`,
